Ans : / means float division
	  // means integer division
	  
Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```

Ans : str_ex = 'iNeuroni'
	  print(str_ex*4)

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.

		else:
					print("Odd")

Q18. What are boolean operator?

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?

Ans : 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords are used in conditional statements.
	ex : if(conditions):
			statement1
		 elif(conditions):
			statement2
		 else:
			statement3

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".

Ans :   age = int(input("Enter your age :"))
		if (age >= 18):
					print("I can vote")
		else:
					print("I can't vote")

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
Ans :   numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
		var = 0
		for i in numbers:
			if i % 2 == 0:
				var = var + i
		print(var)
	  

Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.

Ans :   num1 = int(input("Enter 1st number : "))
		num2 = int(input("Enter 2nd number : "))
		num3 = int(input("Enter 3rd number : "))
		if (num1 > num2 and num1 > num3):
				print("The greatest number between 3 numbers is :",num1)
		elif(num2 > num3 and num2 > num1):
				print("The greatest number between 3 numbers is :",num2)
		else:
				print("The greatest number between 3 numbers is :",num3)
	  
Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```

Ans :   numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
		for i in numbers:
			if i > 500:
				break
			elif i > 150:
				continue
			elif i % 5 == 0:
				print(i)
